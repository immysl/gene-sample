# Gene Sample Project

This project uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) as the template for the project and  also the build tooling. Since Babel and Webpack is already integrated with it, minimum work is required to get it up and running.

The Frontend code was written using React.js library and no library was used to write the CSS. Fetch API is used for the API calls as it is supported by Create React App via Babel.<br>

## Prerequisites

Before running this project there are a few prerequisites. As this project was built on top of Yarn and NPM, the system will require NPM/Yarn set up for it to work. Also `npm install` needs to be run to install all the NPM dependencies i.e. React.js libraries and Create React App scripts.

## Run Gene Sample
